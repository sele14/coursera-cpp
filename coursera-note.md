## Classes in C++
- can create user-defined types
- can associate data and related functionality into a single object

### Encapsulation:
- encloses data and functionality into a single unit (the class)
- can be thought of as data + functionality
- we have private and public data/functionality
- e.g. cube class;
    - private member variables should be typed: "length_"
    - functionality: getVolume()
- public:
    - data/functionality can be accessed by any part of the code
- private:
    - data/functionality can only be accessed by the class itself

### example code; cube class
- see code dir

## C++ Standard Libary

### ```iostream```
- lets us use things like `cout` and `endl`
